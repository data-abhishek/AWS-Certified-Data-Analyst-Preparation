Types of Data:

  Structure Data: Structured data refers to data that is organized in a predefined format, making it easy to search, process, and analyze.
                  It is typically stored in tabular form with rows and columns, such as in relational databases, spreadsheets, or CSV files.
                  Each column represents a specific attribute or field, and each row corresponds to a record or entry.

  Un-Structured Data: Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined format or organization, making it more complex
                      to store, process, and analyze compared to structured data. It can include text, multimedia content, and other formats
                      that lack a rigid schema.

  Semi-Structured Data: Semi-structured data is a type of data that does not conform to the rigid structure of structured data but still includes
                        some organizational properties such as tags or markers that make it easier to process than unstructured data. It serves as
                        a middle ground between structured and unstructured data.

Properties of Data:
  Volume: Social Media
  Velocity: Sensor data fron Iot devices
  Vareity: Structure data, Healthcare data, JSON logs.

Data Warehouses: A centralized repository optimized for analysis where data from different sources is stored in a structured format, ey. Amazon Redshift, 
                 google Bigquery, Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

Data Lake: A storage repository that holds vast amount of raw data in its native format, including structured, semi-structured, un-structured data.
           e.g. Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, Hadoop Distributed File System.

ETL Pipelines:
  Definition: ETL stands for extract, transform and load. It is a process used to move data from sources systems into a data Warehouse.
  Extract: Retrieve raw data from sources systems which can be databases, CRMs, Flat files, API, etc.
           Ensure data integrity during the extraction phase.

Transform:
  Definition: Convert the extracted data into a format suitable for the target data Warehouse.
              Can involve various operations such as:
                Data Cleaning, Data Enrichment, Format Changes, Aggregation on Computation, Handling Missing Values

Load: 
  Definition: Move the transformed data into the target data Warehouse or another data repository
              Can be done in batches (all at once) or in a streaming manner.
              Ensure that data maintains its integrity during the loading phase.
